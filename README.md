## Description

This interactive sketch expresses sadness through a blob character that slowly droops downward as if weighted by melancholy. The blob's movement is lethargic and sluggish, with slower breathing patterns and irregular wobbling. Tears occasionally fall from the blob, fading as they descend. The environment features a muted blue-grey gradient background that evokes a somber, reflective mood.

**Emotional Design Choices:**
- Slow animation speed (0.003 vs original 0.01) creates lethargy
- Downward droop effect simulates the weight of sadness
- Muted, desaturated blue-grey color palette
- Falling tears with fade-out effect
- Serif font (Georgia) for melancholic text
- Increased wobble irregularity suggests emotional distress
