GenAI Transcript - Week 2 Side Quest
Student: Moosa Malik (m57malik)

=== IDEATION PHASE ===

User: I need to express sadness through the blob for my week 2 side quest. What are some ways to show emotion through movement and visuals?

AI: For expressing sadness through animation, consider these approaches:
- Slow, lethargic movement (reduce tSpeed significantly)
- Downward droop or sagging effect (gravity pulling down)
- Muted, desaturated colors (greys, blues)
- Adding visual elements like tears or rain
- Irregular, less energetic wobbling
- Dark or moody background

User: I like the droop idea and tears. How would I add a droop effect to make it sag downward?

AI: You can add a droopAmount variable that increases over time and affects the y-coordinates of the bottom vertices more than the top ones. Use sin(angle) to determine which points are at the bottom.

=== CODING ASSISTANCE ===

User: Can you help me add tears that fall from the blob?

AI: You'll want to create a Tear class with x, y position, falling speed, and opacity that fades. Store tears in an array, spawn them occasionally with random(), update their position each frame, and remove them when they fade out or leave the screen.

User: How do I make the background look more sad/melancholic?

AI: Create a gradient using lerpColor() from darker blue-grey at top to slightly lighter at bottom. This creates atmospheric depth. You can write a setGradient() helper function.

=== DEBUGGING ===

User: The tears aren't fading properly

AI: Make sure you're decreasing the opacity in the update() method and passing it as the 4th parameter to fill(). Also check that you're removing tears when opacity <= 0.

User: How do I make the droop effect stronger at the bottom?

AI: Use a droopFactor based on sin(a) mapped from 0.5 to 1.5, so bottom points (where sin(a) is positive) droop more than top points.
